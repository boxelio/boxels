# Boxels
Boxel is recipe-driven embedded device software used to create topic-focused operating systems, such as an SDR-focused distribution for Raspberry Pis or a whitehat security toolkit for ODROIDs. Boxels are the combination of BoxOS (slim customized cross-platform Debian), custom bootloader, Docker, and a dynamically provided recipe.

# Primary focuses:
  * ease of use by users - consumers/users can easily bootstrap, update, and reimage their embedded devices using a mobile device (iPhone/Android)
  * simplicity - ease to create a custom OS image by defining a simple recipe
  * available - platform and distribution nodes to make it easy to use and always available (BoxelHub)
  * optimized - slim and hyper-focused on the topic, unnecessary software is not installed so that the hardware can shine
  * open - Boxel developers can define a recipe, share it on BoxelHub, allow others to fork and modify
  * affordable - free to use by users and developers, revenue eventually from companies for distribution, monitoring, assistance/support, etc.

- A basic website is up now at https://www.boxel.io/

*We are currently looking for other developers to join us in the effort and build out the platform, BoxOS, image flasher tool, and mobile apps.*
